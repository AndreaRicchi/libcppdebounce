Header-only C++17 library for safe **throttling** and **debouncing** using only the standard library.

📖 [API documentation](https://andrearicchi.github.io/libcppdebounce/)

`libcppdebounce` provides two lightweight utilities:

| Feature | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Throttle** | First call is executed immediately, all subsequent calls are ignored for a fixed time interval |
| **Debounce** | Execution is deferred until calls stop; repeated calls reset the delay |

Useful for rate-limiting high-frequency events such as UI callbacks, hardware interrupts, logging bursts, periodic updates, and asynchronous input streams.
